   - Carefully read the entire outline to grasp the overall topic and the relationship between main points and subpoints.
   - Identify the key themes and objectives that need to be conveyed.

2. ### Expand on Each Point
   - For each main heading and subheading, write comprehensive paragraphs that dive deeper into the topic.
