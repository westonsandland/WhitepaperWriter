# Executive Summary: Assessing the Impact of the 2026 Medicare Advantage Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization

## Introduction

The upcoming introduction of the **2026 Medicare Advantage Member Notices** represents a significant shift in how **Medicare Advantage (MA)** plans communicate with their beneficiaries about **supplemental benefits**. These notices are designed to enhance awareness and encourage utilization of additional services beyond standard Medicare coverage. This executive summary examines the potential impact of these notices on supplemental benefit utilization, challenging prevailing actuarial views, and highlighting factors that may influence member engagement. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for executives involved in policy-making, healthcare provision, and strategic planning within the Medicare landscape.

## Main Points

- **Prevailing Actuarial Perspective**: The actuarial community generally anticipates a negligible impact from the 2026 Member Notices on supplemental benefit utilization. This view is based on historical data suggesting that members who have not previously utilized these benefits are unlikely to change their behavior solely due to increased information.

- **Challenging the Consensus**: Contrasting this perspective, the analysis argues that increased awareness through the notices could indeed influence member behavior. Non-utilizers may have lacked awareness or found previous information insufficient, and the notices could serve as a catalyst for increased engagement.

- **Factors Influencing Impact**:
  1. **Ease of Use**: Supplemental benefits that are easy to access, such as **over-the-counter (OTC) allowances**, may see higher utilization as barriers to access are minimal. Clear information can prompt members to take advantage of these accessible benefits.
  2. **Relevance and Immediate Need**: Members' likelihood to utilize benefits correlates with the perceived relevance to their immediate health needs. Awareness of benefits like **hearing aids** or **transportation services** can lead to increased utilization among those who need them.
  3. **Benefit Eligibility and SSBCIs**: The notices may particularly impact utilization of **Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs)** by informing eligible members of benefits they were unaware they qualified for, thus potentially increasing engagement among this subgroup.

- **Behavioral Responses**: Psychological factors, such as the **awareness effect**, suggest that providing information can lead to behavioral changes. Enhanced communication may empower members to make informed decisions, reducing information asymmetry.

- **Data Insights and Trends**: Although specific data on the 2026 notices is not yet available, existing research indicates that direct communication can increase service utilization. For instance, patient reminders have improved adherence to preventive services in other healthcare contexts.

## Recommendations

- **Targeted Communication Strategies**: Develop tailored messaging within the notices that addresses specific barriers to utilization, such as complexity or lack of awareness, to maximize their impact.

- **Simplify Access Processes**: Streamline the procedures for accessing supplemental benefits to encourage uptake, emphasizing ease of use in communications.

- **Monitor and Analyze Utilization Patterns**: Implement mechanisms to track changes in benefit utilization following the distribution of the notices to assess their effectiveness and inform future strategies.

- **Engage with Eligible Subgroups**: Focus on members eligible for SSBCIs by providing clear eligibility information and guidance on how to access these specialized benefits.

## Conclusion

The **2026 Medicare Advantage Member Notices** present a strategic opportunity to enhance member engagement with supplemental benefits. While traditional actuarial models predict minimal impact based on past utilization patterns, this analysis highlights that increased awareness and targeted communication can lead to meaningful changes in member behavior. By considering factors such as ease of use, relevance, and eligibility clarity, organizations can leverage the notices to improve health outcomes and align with organizational goals of increased benefit utilization. Ongoing evaluation will be essential to measure the actual impact and refine approaches accordingly.
