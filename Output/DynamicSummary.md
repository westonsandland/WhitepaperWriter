# Impact Analysis of 2026 Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization in Medicare Advantage

## Introduction

The impending implementation of the 2026 Member Notices in Medicare Advantage plans is a strategic initiative aimed at informing beneficiaries about their available supplemental benefits. While it is generally anticipated that these notices will have minimal impact on utilization—targeting members with zero prior use—the actual effect on non-utilizers may vary significantly. Understanding these potential impacts is crucial for Medicare Advantage organizations to align their strategies, optimize benefit utilization, and enhance member satisfaction.

## Main Points

### Benefit Ease of Use

- **Simplifying Access Increases Utilization**: Supplemental benefits that are straightforward and require minimal effort to access are more likely to experience increased utilization following the Member Notices.
  
- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Benefits Example**:
  - **Convenience**: OTC benefits allow members to purchase health-related items without prescriptions, using allotted allowances through easy-to-navigate catalogs, online platforms, or retail partnerships.
  - **Heightened Awareness**: The notices may significantly boost awareness among non-utilizers, leading to a measurable uptick in benefit use due to low barriers to entry and immediate value perception.

### Limitations on the Need for Services

- **Necessity Drives Utilization**: Not all supplemental benefits are universally needed. Services like hearing aids and transportation are essential only to members with specific needs.
  
- **Minimal Impact Expected**:
  - **Hearing Aids**: Members without hearing impairments are unlikely to utilize this benefit despite increased awareness.
  - **Transportation Services**: Those with personal transportation means may not change their utilization patterns.

### Benefit Eligibility Constraints and SSBCIs

- **Understanding SSBCIs**: Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs) are targeted benefits requiring specific clinical eligibility.
  
- **Limited Utilization Uptake**:
  - **Eligibility Limitations**: Increased awareness may not translate into higher utilization due to restrictive eligibility criteria.
  - **Complex Enrollment**: Potential complexities in accessing these benefits can deter even eligible members from utilization.

## Recommendations

### Targeted Communication Strategies

- **Personalized Engagement**: Develop tailored communication efforts that address individual member needs and circumstances to enhance effectiveness beyond general notices.
  
- **Member Education Initiatives**:
  - **Value Proposition Clarity**: Clearly articulate how benefits directly improve health outcomes or quality of life.
  - **Barrier Reduction**: Educate members to overcome perceived obstacles such as misunderstandings about costs or eligibility.

### Simplify Access Processes

- **Streamline Enrollment Procedures**:
  - **Ease of Access**: Simplify the processes for enrolling in and accessing benefits, particularly for SSBCIs, to reduce barriers for eligible members.
  
- **Enhance User Experience**:
  - **Platform Improvements**: Optimize the usability of catalogs, online portals, and other platforms through which benefits are accessed.
  - **Customer Support**: Provide robust support to assist members in navigating their benefits.

## Conclusion

The actual influence of the 2026 Member Notices on supplemental benefit utilization among non-utilizers will depend on a combination of factors:

- **Awareness vs. Necessity and Eligibility**: Increased awareness does not guarantee increased utilization if the benefits are not needed or members are ineligible.
  
- **Ease of Use**: Benefits that are simple and convenient to access are more likely to see an uptick in utilization.

To effectively enhance benefit utilization and align with organizational objectives:

- **Adopt a Multifaceted Approach**: Go beyond general notices by incorporating personalized communications, education, and support.
  
- **Address Specific Needs and Barriers**: Tailor strategies to meet diverse member needs and reduce obstacles to benefit access.

**Strategic Alignment**: By implementing these recommendations, Medicare Advantage organizations can improve member engagement, optimize the utilization of supplemental benefits, and achieve better health outcomes, thereby strengthening their competitive position in the evolving healthcare landscape.
