# The Potential Impact of 2026 Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization in Medicare Advantage

*Introduction*

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans continue to gain popularity among Medicare beneficiaries due to the additional supplemental benefits they offer beyond traditional Medicare coverage. The anticipated 2026 Member Notices aim to enhance beneficiary awareness and utilization of these supplemental benefits. This essay examines the potential impact of these notices on supplemental benefit utilization, incorporating recent statistics, demographic trends, and insights from past Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiatives.

*Increasing Enrollment in Medicare Advantage*

Medicare Advantage enrollment has been steadily rising over the past decade. As of 2023, more than 31 million people are enrolled in MA plans, accounting for approximately 51% of all eligible Medicare beneficiaries (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, "Medicare Advantage Enrollment"). This marks the first time that MA enrollment has exceeded half of the Medicare population, reflecting a growing preference for the additional benefits and flexibility that MA plans offer.

*Trends in Supplemental Benefit Utilization*

Despite the availability of supplemental benefits such as dental, vision, hearing, and wellness programs, utilization rates remain lower than expected. A survey conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) found that only about 45% of MA enrollees take full advantage of their supplemental benefits (MedPAC 2022). Factors contributing to this underutilization include a lack of awareness, complexity of plan information, and perceived barriers to access.

*Effectiveness of Past CMS Initiatives*

Past CMS initiatives provide valuable insights into how educational efforts can influence beneficiary behavior. For example, the 2019 "What's Covered" mobile app launched by CMS aimed to provide clear information about Medicare coverage. Following its release, there was a 15% increase in the use of preventive services among beneficiaries who used the app (CMS, "'What's Covered' App Usage Statistics"). Similarly, the 2021 "Comparing Medicare Advantage Plans" campaign led to a significant uptick in beneficiaries reviewing and switching to plans that better met their needs (Kaiser Family Foundation).

These initiatives demonstrate that when beneficiaries are provided with accessible and understandable information, they are more likely to engage with their benefits. This suggests that the 2026 Member Notices could have a substantial impact on increasing supplemental benefit utilization.

*Demographic Shifts and Digital Engagement*

The demographic landscape of the Medicare population is changing, with an increasing number of beneficiaries who are more digitally engaged. As of 2021, 75% of Americans aged 65 and older use the internet, and 61% own a smartphone (Pew Research Center). This shift toward digital literacy among older adults presents an opportunity for CMS to leverage digital platforms in disseminating the 2026 Member Notices.

Moreover, the younger cohort of Medicare beneficiaries is more proactive about preventive health and wellness. The Baby Boomer generation, now entering Medicare eligibility, places a higher emphasis on maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle (National Council on Aging). By tailoring the notices to address the interests and preferences of this demographic, CMS can enhance the effectiveness of the communication.

*Evidence Supporting Increased Utilization Through Awareness*

Studies have shown that increased awareness through informational campaigns leads to higher utilization of available benefits. A 2020 study in the *Journal of Health Economics* found that targeted mailings about preventive services resulted in a 7% increase in service utilization (Baicker et al.). Another study highlighted that personalized communication is more effective in encouraging beneficiaries to use supplemental benefits (*Health Affairs*).

These findings support the premise that the 2026 Member Notices, if well-designed and personalized, could significantly boost the utilization of supplemental benefits by making beneficiaries more aware of what is available to them.

*Barriers to Supplemental Benefit Utilization*

Understanding the barriers to supplemental benefit utilization is essential for addressing them effectively. Common barriers include:

- **Lack of Awareness:** Many beneficiaries are unaware of the supplemental benefits included in their plans (MedPAC 2022).
- **Complex Information:** Complicated plan documents can make it difficult for beneficiaries to understand their benefits (Commonwealth Fund).
- **Access Issues:** Geographic and transportation barriers can limit access to certain services, even when beneficiaries are aware of them.

By addressing these barriers in the 2026 Member Notices—such as simplifying language, highlighting key benefits, and providing resources for assistance—CMS can help beneficiaries overcome obstacles to utilization.

*Economic Factors Influencing Beneficiary Behavior*

Economic considerations, such as inflation and rising healthcare costs, play a significant role in how beneficiaries use their benefits. In 2022, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for seniors increased by 5% due to inflation (Bureau of Labor Statistics). As costs rise, beneficiaries may forgo non-essential services, including some supplemental benefits.

However, emphasizing the cost-saving aspects of preventive and supplemental services—such as how dental care can prevent more expensive treatments later—can encourage beneficiaries to utilize these benefits despite economic pressures.

*Recommendations and Future Directions*

To enhance the effectiveness of the 2026 Member Notices and increase supplemental benefit utilization, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Include Case Studies of Successful Initiatives:** Providing detailed examples of past CMS or private insurer initiatives that successfully increased supplemental benefit utilization can offer valuable lessons and strategies.

2. **Leverage Technological Solutions:** Utilizing technology, such as mobile apps and online portals, can facilitate better communication and engagement with beneficiaries regarding their supplemental benefits.

3. **Policy Implications:** Exploring policy changes that support increased utilization, such as incentivizing providers to promote supplemental benefits or simplifying enrollment processes, can further enhance benefit uptake.

*Further Research Suggestions*

- **Beneficiary Perspectives:** Conducting surveys or focus groups to gather direct feedback from beneficiaries about what would make them more likely to utilize supplemental benefits can provide actionable insights.

- **Longitudinal Studies:** Assessing the long-term health outcomes and cost savings associated with increased utilization of supplemental benefits can strengthen the argument for investing in awareness campaigns.

*Conclusion*

The 2026 Member Notices have the potential to significantly impact supplemental benefit utilization in Medicare Advantage plans. By incorporating strategies that increase awareness, address demographic shifts, and overcome barriers, CMS can enhance the effectiveness of these notices. This, in turn, can lead to better health outcomes for beneficiaries and more efficient use of healthcare resources.
