# The Impact of 2026 Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization in Medicare Advantage

As the healthcare landscape evolves, Medicare Advantage plans continue to play a pivotal role in providing comprehensive coverage to beneficiaries. One upcoming change is the implementation of the 2026 Member Notices, intended to inform members about their supplemental benefits. While there is a general consensus in the actuarial community that these notices will have a negligible impact—since they target members with zero utilization—the reality may be more complex. The actual effect on non-utilizers could vary significantly based on several key factors.

## Benefit Ease of Use

### Simplifying Access to Benefits

One of the primary factors influencing supplemental benefit utilization is the ease with which members can access and use these benefits. Benefits that are straightforward and require minimal effort to utilize are more likely to see an increase in uptake following the dissemination of Member Notices.

#### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Benefits as an Example

Over-the-counter (OTC) benefits exemplify the impact of ease of use on utilization rates. OTC benefits typically allow members to purchase everyday health-related items without a prescription, using a predetermined allowance provided by their plan. The simplicity of this process—often facilitated through catalogs, online platforms, or retail partnerships—makes it highly accessible to members.

- **Convenience**: Members can acquire necessary items without the need for medical appointments or complex approval processes.
- **Awareness**: Member Notices could heighten awareness of these already accessible benefits, prompting previously uninformed members to take advantage.

**Potential Impact**: For benefits like OTC allowances, the Member Notices may lead to a measurable uptick in utilization among non-utilizers, as the barriers to entry are low and the immediate value is clear.

## Limitations on the Need for Services

### Varied Necessity Among Members

Not all supplemental benefits are universally needed by all members. Services such as hearing aids, dental care, or transportation are essential for some but unnecessary for others. The Member Notices may have limited impact on the utilization of these services among non-utilizers simply because the need does not exist.

#### Specific Services Affecting Utilization Rates

- **Hearing Aids**: Only members with hearing impairments will find value in hearing aid benefits. Non-utilizers without hearing issues are unlikely to change their usage patterns despite receiving notices.
- **Transportation Services**: Members who are homebound or lack personal transportation may rely heavily on these services. Conversely, those with personal vehicles or other means of transportation may not utilize these benefits regardless of awareness.

**Potential Impact**: For benefits tied closely to specific needs, Member Notices may have minimal effect on utilization among non-utilizers without those needs. The inherent lack of necessity serves as a natural barrier to increased uptake.

## Benefit Eligibility and Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs)

### Understanding SSBCIs

Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs) are tailored benefits aimed at individuals with chronic conditions. Eligibility for SSBCIs is not universal; beneficiaries must meet specific clinical criteria, which can limit the pool of potential users.

#### Influence of Eligibility on Utilization

- **Awareness vs. Eligibility**: Even if Member Notices increase awareness of SSBCIs, members who do not meet the eligibility requirements cannot utilize these benefits.
- **Complex Enrollment Processes**: Eligible members may still face hurdles if the process for accessing SSBCIs is complex or not well understood.

**Potential Impact**: The impact of Member Notices on SSBCI utilization may be modest. While increased awareness is beneficial, eligibility constraints and potential complexities in the enrollment process may limit significant changes in utilization rates among non-utilizers.

## Trends and Data Supporting the Analysis

### Historical Utilization Patterns

Historically, changes in communication strategies within Medicare Advantage plans have yielded mixed results in altering member behavior.

- **Communication Efficacy**: Studies have shown that simply increasing the volume of information does not necessarily lead to higher utilization rates for specialized services.
- **Targeted Engagement**: Personalized communication efforts tend to be more effective, particularly when they address specific member needs and circumstances.

### The Role of Member Education

Educating members about the value and applicability of supplemental benefits is crucial.

- **Understanding Value**: When members comprehend how a benefit directly improves their health or quality of life, they are more likely to utilize it.
- **Overcoming Barriers**: Education can also help reduce perceived barriers to utilization, such as misunderstandings about costs or eligibility requirements.

## Conclusion

The forthcoming 2026 Member Notices in Medicare Advantage plans are poised to play a role in shaping supplemental benefit utilization. However, the extent of their impact on non-utilizers remains uncertain and is likely to vary based on:

- **Benefit Ease of Use**: Benefits that are simple to access, like OTC allowances, may see increased utilization due to the low barriers for members.
- **Limitations on the Need for Services**: For services that not all members need, such as hearing aids or transportation, utilization rates may remain largely unchanged.
- **Benefit Eligibility (SSBCIs)**: Eligibility requirements for specialized benefits can limit the potential impact of increased awareness from Member Notices.

Ultimately, while Member Notices are an important step in informing beneficiaries about their available benefits, their actual influence on utilization among non-utilizers will depend on a combination of awareness, necessity, eligibility, and the ease with which members can access these services. Plans aiming to enhance utilization may need to adopt a multifaceted approach that goes beyond notices, incorporating personalized engagement and support to address the specific needs and barriers faced by their members.
