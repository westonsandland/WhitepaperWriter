# Analyzing the Impact of 2026 Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization in Medicare Advantage

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans continue to adapt to better serve their beneficiaries. In 2026, new Member Notices will be introduced to enhance awareness and utilization of supplemental benefits provided under MA plans. These notices aim to inform members—particularly those who have not previously utilized certain benefits—about the services available to them beyond standard Medicare coverage. Understanding the potential impact of these notices is crucial for stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and actuaries, as it may influence future strategies in member engagement and benefit design.

## General Consensus

Within the actuarial community, there is a prevailing view that the introduction of the 2026 Member Notices will have a negligible impact on the utilization of supplemental benefits. This perspective is grounded in the assumption that the notices will primarily reach members who have historically shown zero utilization of these benefits. From this standpoint, if members have not utilized the benefits despite their availability, simply informing them may not be sufficient to alter their behavior. Actuaries often rely on historical data and utilization patterns, suggesting that factors such as member inertia or lack of perceived need will continue to dominate, thereby limiting the impact of the notices.

## Challenging the Consensus

However, this consensus warrants a closer examination. There are compelling reasons to question whether the impact of the 2026 Member Notices will indeed be negligible. Non-utilizers represent a diverse group with varied reasons for not accessing benefits, ranging from lack of awareness and understanding to perceived complexity in accessing services. The assumption that these members will remain indifferent overlooks potential behavioral shifts prompted by increased information and simplified access. The notices could serve as a catalyst for change, transforming passive non-utilizers into active participants in their healthcare benefits.

## Factors Influencing Impact

### Ease of Use of Benefits

One critical factor that could influence the impact of the notices is the ease with which members can utilize certain supplemental benefits. Benefits such as over-the-counter (OTC) allowances are inherently user-friendly, often requiring minimal effort to access. The provision of clear information through the notices could lower barriers and encourage members to take advantage of these benefits. For instance, if members learn they can easily obtain OTC medications at no additional cost, this newfound awareness, paired with straightforward redemption processes, may lead to increased utilization.

### Need for Services

The relevance and immediate need for specific benefits play a significant role in determining member response. Supplemental benefits like hearing aids or transportation services address particular needs that may not be universally applicable. Members who do not perceive a current need for these services may remain unresponsive to the notices. Conversely, those who do require such services but were previously unaware of their coverage could be prompted by the notices to utilize them timely. Understanding the alignment between member needs and available benefits is essential in anticipating utilization changes.

### Benefit Eligibility (SSBCIs)

Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs) introduce another layer of complexity. These benefits are targeted toward members with specific chronic conditions and have eligibility criteria that must be met. The notices could potentially educate eligible members about benefits for which they were unaware they qualified, leading to an uptick in utilization among these groups. However, the impact may be moderated by the understanding and clarity provided regarding eligibility requirements. If the notices effectively communicate eligibility and enrollment processes, they could significantly influence member engagement with SSBCIs.

## Potential Behavioral Responses

Psychological and behavioral factors are pivotal in shaping how members might respond to the 2026 Member Notices. Concepts such as the awareness effect suggest that increased information can lead to behavioral change. The notices might reduce information asymmetry, empowering members to make informed decisions about their health benefits. Additionally, factors like the perceived value of benefits, trust in the plan provider, and the ease of navigating benefit utilization processes can influence member actions. The notices could potentially activate latent needs or prompt reconsideration of previously overlooked services.

## Data and Trends

While specific data on the 2026 Member Notices are not yet available, insights can be drawn from existing studies on member behavior in response to notifications about benefits. Research indicates that direct communication increases awareness and can lead to increased utilization of services. For example, studies have shown that reminders and educational materials sent to patients can improve adherence to preventive services and screenings. In the context of MA plans, similar trends may emerge, where personalized and clear communication prompts members to engage more fully with their available benefits.

## Conclusion

The anticipated implementation of the 2026 Member Notices in Medicare Advantage plans presents an opportunity to potentially enhance supplemental benefit utilization among members. While the actuarial consensus leans toward a negligible impact, a deeper analysis reveals several factors that could drive a different outcome. Ease of benefit use, relevance to member needs, eligibility clarity, and behavioral responses all play integral roles in shaping member engagement. As the healthcare industry moves forward, it will be crucial to monitor the actual impact of the notices and conduct further research to fully understand their effectiveness. This understanding will inform future strategies to optimize benefit utilization and improve member health outcomes.
